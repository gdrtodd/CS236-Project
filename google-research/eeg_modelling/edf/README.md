# EDF

Library to convert from EDF file format to tensorflow.Example for model
training. An example application is provided for the Temple University Hospital
(TUH) seizure dataset and has been tested on the same.

## Requirements:

- Bazel 0.19.2.
This was the version that worked with tensorflow 1.13.1, the
most recent one as of June 2019 according to www.tensorflow.org/install/source

- Lullaby
This library is used to parse command-line arguments but it does not have a
release, hence could not be included in the WORKSPACE. As a workaround until lullaby has an official release, clone it into the
eeg_modelling folder (where the file WORKSPACE exists):
`git clone https://github.com/google/lullaby.git`.

## Usage

### Transform a Temple (TUH) EDF file to TF.Example:

- `bazel run edf:temple_edf_to_tf_example -- --edf_path <edf_path> --output_path <output_path>`,
where `<edf_path>` is the original EDF filepath, and `<output_path>` is the
desired path for the output file.
