  """Compute rank for compression from input matrix shape and rank factor.

  Args:
    matrix_shape: tuple corresponding to the shape of the matrix that will be
      compressed.
    rank_factor: int corresponding to the amount to compress by. New rank will
      be (old_rank * 100 / rank_factor).

  Returns:
    The new rank. Note, if the computed rank is greater than the current rank,
    the current rank will be returned. This prevents "compressing" to a rank
    larger than the current rank.
