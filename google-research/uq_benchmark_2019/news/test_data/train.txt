more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed their freedoms bunch utopian arrogent socialist jerks article talk politics misc new liberation news service nlns igc apc org

friendly face does rush limbaugh remind you anyone daevid bornhuetter machen the madison edge the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh that hitler was original and showed initiative mort sahl the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october although find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale limbaugh find him entertaining and often agree with his conclusions the fact that sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining nlns believe not was planning this comparative review mein kampf and limbaugh transcribed rant the way things ought before sahl issued his comparative review usual sahl was independent and sharp scalpel effort can only dream comparing favorably mort least has fairly popular orginating premise everyone mention the idea thought was either divinely inspired least past due for delivery those reactions are based parallels that should obvious the most peripheral observer the acts those false prophets both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills which they both used with passion generate political cult massive numerical proportions fact limbaugh claims have audience just over million almost identical the number votes cast for hitler the april german election both used myopic social perspective build the cult and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record fabricate their ideological quilt actually find limbaugh oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking even though his conclusions are often correct would suggest that bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes use concentrated political power and loaded gun force everyone the right things where right defined the elitist academics who lead the movement showing acute case myopic social perspective not mention arrogance and utter stupidity limbaugh certainly far from perfect but his opponents the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for federal control virtually all aspects the lives the citizenry and for the elimination local control over affairs public perhaps limbaugh has following because the people are tired being treated like errant children self important group arrogant controlling myopic people who have understanding how life operates outside the oughta inside their own hopelessly closed minds the last point glaringly documented passages the opening pages both books hitler example when page claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter bombed part railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg being caught the act was betrayed france representative his government when there has never been any factual foundation for such statement fact the governments both the reich and prussia well the vatican actively intervened save him from execution and almost succeeded let take your word for that and work with nice specific incident limbaugh follows suit making the hysterically sarcastic claim his introduction that school during commencement ceremony many other public places god unconstitutional course not god but the official imposition particular concepts god against individual will that unconstitutional but limbaugh too gleeful his talent for distortion want you know that hmmm congress shall pass law regarding establishment religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof liberal translation the federal government long run liberals may force local school districts include certain iconic content christmas displays while prohibiting others think limbaugh has you this one seems that arguing for less imposition the federal government into religion nice job the specificity that one too analysis historical modern communication media deleted but mort sahl also observed the radio the other night some cloutmeister the radical right wants limbaugh focal point their propoganda and remember sahl haig conservative these days mort might not know exactly who rush equivalent rodolf hess the book itself suggests mclaughlin the former president abc radio and now limbaugh partner efm media the radio program production company but mort himself veteran the talk show having hosted them new york washington and los angeles knows what evil lurks the hearts major market media men knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed silver platter and handed him limbaugh earns his money just honestly capone did almost worthy rico indictment yes conspiracy profound proportions methinks that you may bit resentful limbaugh success because you attribute primarily luck how after all could anyone with profound differences opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation conspiracy blind luck you feel this same level knee jerk resentment against lottery winners you congratulate them their good fortune questions social issues there overabundance material the limbaugh book that seems echo hitler venom for example this should great fun since the liberal movement america that pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control the people and business government business partnership indeed and limbaugh the populist nemesis that movement have read limbaugh book and although was not the most literary piece have read recent memory certainly did not contain venom all let alone venom comparable individual who callously murdered millions out racism their own qualifications control society hitler out the host sometimes millions people who individually more less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand one man author emphasis must step forward order form with apodeictic force out the wavering world imagination the great masses granite principles and take the fight for their sole correctness until out the playing waves free world thought brazen rock uniform combination form and will arises page very serious tone that oratory limbaugh who needs the media when they got the show devoted exclusively what think the phrase with half brain tied behind back make even denotes the egress mental aptitude require engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with might take four five years but convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around way thinking kicking and screaming all the way pages and respectively you neglect mention that limbaugh have you ever listened his show btw continuously encourages his audience think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon himself included you yourself mention that makes bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions also adopts rather satirical approach and presumes his audience intelligent enough distinguish satire from seriousness and says much this contrast the average mass media show which the audience treated society intellectual lowest common denominator sure that adolf hitler was master satire sure was just kidding when said that the jews were the cause germany problems and needed exterminated religion the basis nation hitler this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound with the existence the aryan his dying off his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils time without culture who dares lay hand upon the highest image the lord sins against the benevolent creator this miracle and helps the expulsion from paradise page this not religion clearly perverse worship race since christ was jew seems quite unlikely that hitler characterization the aryan the highest image the lord fits with christian doctrine limbaugh america was founded judeo christian country but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile ambivalent toward religion people for whom belief god best charming superstition have managed ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years only coincidence that the quality american education has declined ever since pages private religious schools have vastly better record success than publicly funded schools american history indeed primarily judeo christian suppose that limbaugh pointing out facts equivalent adolf hitler worshiping the aryan race think you might reaching just wee bit here popular culture reason for social collapse hitler the fight against the poisoning the soul has set one has only look the menus our movie houses vaudevilles and theatres and one can hardly deny that this not the right kind food theatre art literature movies the press billposters and window displays must cleaned the symptoms rotting world and put into the service moral idea state and culture pages and definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here limbaugh today hollywood trouble the reason that hollywood has forgotten who its audience they make fun people who believe god they ridicule the traditional family heterosexuality and monagamy they disparage american heroes page just guess here but don think that limbaugh would advocate government control hollywood you should perhaps call his radio show confirm this believe this more criticism hollywood and the depraved moral values espouses not advocation government control hollywood liberals the other hand want have complete government control our school systems that the government can teach the people early age the right way view religion and morality believe limbaugh against this his satirical use the young heads full mush hyperbole indicates the news meida hitler the activity the called liberal press was the work gravediggers for the german people and the german reich one can pass silence the marxist papers lies task only break the people folkish and national spine order make ripe for the yoke slavery international capital and its masters the jews page pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here with implicit plea for government power used break the conspiracy limbaugh elements the media have jumped the bandwagon leftist causes the cynical journalist the past has been replaced many cases enthusiastic cheerleader for causes during the gulf war cnn correspondent bernard shaw said cnn global network can take sides cant take sides they don realize that their freedom lies the united states america and that therefore they should defend this nation they are hopelessly misguided and may suggest flirting with megalomania pages and indication here that elements the media since career self selected categorization perhaps inferred larger percentage than represented the populace large has leftist bias doesn sound too unreasonable insinuation that cnn should not report objective fashion only that for reporters say that they not have any personal bias the situation disingenuous megalomaniacal you may disagree and may well exagerrated but not unreasonable opinion and limbaugh goes well out his way make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions unlike most other reporting that purports achieve perfect objectivity but actuality will some degree other statistical sense reflect the biases the reporters who being disingenuous here shaw limbaugh again you should ask limbaugh himself but expect that would oppose government control the media continue these comparative excerpts certainly possible but ultimately too depressing take one reading indeed depressing see such myopia and tiresome liberal arrogance liberals love play games with paradigms way discrediting people who disagree with them why don you challenge conservative ideology intellectual level rather than engaging ludicrous comparisons perhaps the underpinnings your ideology are intellectual only that they exist your mind not the real world after putting these books down there one undeniable fact that haunts the adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate hatred those around them turn allowed germans hand their collective national power the nazis the rush limbaugh doing the very same thing distributing hatred depressed and frightened americans turn helping the american radical right maintain its power base the year nightmare the reagan bush era comes end hoping rebuild into their hopes for the fascist states america perhaps there are few among the intellectually challenged who percieve rush limbaugh hate monger but experience has been spreading laughter the ludicrous self importance the left not hatred bush you may correct about his fascist economic leanings reagan the other hand did his best reverse the fascist trend government involvement business clinton increasing fascism america through business government partnership and increased levels taxation perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes grade school and limbaugh not repellant hitler only because the radical right utilizes limbaugh its own gateway opiate one can only wonder what the ultimate drug they plan hook america hmmm seems that limbaugh not any way comparable hitler because has not murdered six million jews and many many others out racism come from mixed race family quite well attuned racism don hear any coming from rush limbaugh the only place hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously from the liberal left the liberal left the movement see trying get america hooked the opiates socialized medicine socialized transportation socialized education etc the left already has america hopelessly

would ported and possibly sun environment pci company called pci inc out richmond hill ontario canada makes array software utilities for processing manipulation and use remote sensing data eight ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and couple others whose titles forget the software available versions for dos unix workstations among them sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms now use the vms version the pci software consists several classes groups packages utilities grouped function but all operating common pci database disk file the tape package set utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into write those formats out from the pci database file this the only package use know much about other packages can display data from the pci database one another several pci supported third party color displays output numeric bitmap representation image data attached printer epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might more spe cifically interested the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations multiply channel add channel and store channel and god only knows what all else there lot don have and don use these can say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility controlled from one eight parameters read from common parameter file which must vms anyway your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for different purpose can get bit confusing setting series operations the standard pci environment contains scripting language very similar ibm basic but which allows you automate the process setting parameters for common complicated lengthy difficult series utility executions vms can also invoke utilities independently from dcl command procedure there also optional programming library which allows you write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such level operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle images you can figure out ways handle few other things well for instance the tape package offers utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop the macintosh calls raw data from tape number different interleave orders this turns out ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry format would probably haven tried handle targa and above all however you have know what you doing you can screw the nth degree and have start over worth noting that the pci database file designed contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner other information observe that remote sensing image tape often contains all manner information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc the original satellite pass all this can into the pci database believe that workstations the built display used vax systems other than workstations pci supports only couple specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems come mind one personal workarounds was display program which would display directly from pci database file peritek vct bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could overkill your case seems designed for the very high end applications users those for whom mac largely doesn suffice although you know the gap getting smaller all the time probably coincidence that pci located canada country which does lot its land resource management via remote sensing believe the canadian government uses pci software
