17 saudi clergy and their western supporters human rights ilyess sez how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled back the iraqi invasion were you charge saudi arabia all muslims knew that the whole thing was set destroy iraq not liberate kuwait the people who were killed the invasion are more many many more than the ones that were killed the iraqis their smaller invasion lived the west and have seen how your media prepared you helpless naive americans for war against doubt you plan exploiting helpless naive americans for your own purposes hmm let see iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that led the invasion the cia correctly predicted and pretended surprised not know just happened that saddam was predictible and arrogant and stupid what would have done most muslims would choose dead kuwaitis over dead iraqis and dead kuwaitis the first case would happen western intervention happened and the second case was direct indirect result western envolvement possibly iraqis had indeed died but this number based greenpeace estimates greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war condemning the potential environmental consequences allied miiltary action while initially completely ignoring iraq horrible environmental crimes starting with the dumping millions barrels oil into the gulf ahmadi the blowing over oil wells what the real number there has been lot work this the last two years none reported the greenpeace figure seems get continuously bandied about the real number seems around the same order the number kuwaitis killed tortured and kidnapped during the occupation included article recently posted below but this really old news independent television news reported figure around only few months after the war but was hardly reported for the allies have killed iraqis they would have had kill twice the total number iraqis kuwait the favored image the hysterics the last battle the war mutla this was yet another example the american and european media playing into the hands iraq and its facto allies the destruction the iraqi convoy mutla was portrayed all out slaughter this simply not true the head and tail the convoy was bombed initially resulting lot casualties these points before bombers came back most the rest the iraqi soldiers fled foot furthermore your estimates kuwaiti war dead allies hadn invaded completely ridiculous you have acknowledged certainly implicitly that saddam barbarous brute you have acknowledged the hundreds thousands has been responible for killing his own country you know that the man appointed governor kuwait ali majid was his most brutal henchman presiding over the near genocide the kurds the late and more recently the shi yet when comes his treatment kuwaitis angel your estimate would killed fewer than already had when the war started what joke apn iraq war dead copyright the associated press all rights reserved nick ludington associated press writer washington after the persian gulf war ended the world was told that many iraqi soldiers were killed one point even baghdad put the toll that high did the defense intelligence agency private but officials have been backpedaling ever since even though the pentagon has yet settle official estimate release the public now one former dia analyst says the number iraqi troops killed may have been low that conclusion john heidenrich writing the current issue the quarterly magazine foreign policy represents the lowest estimate yet from defense sources the revisions suggesting less devastating iraqi toll fit pattern vastly moderated military claims the months after the war ended claims for number weapons also were scaled down despite the dramatic videotapes successful weaponry the shocking pictures iraq disastrous retreat from kuwait arguments have continued unabated about what really happened the gulf war heidenrich not the first question the iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired more that year ago air force gen charles horner the commander the air campaign the gulf war said believed the iraqi military death toll was fewer than for the entire war the pentagon itself still refuses provide estimate the number iraqis who died the day war against the led coalition january and february monday pentagon spokesman cmdr joe gradisher reiterated past statements that there just isn number that credible but some current internal estimates range from iraqi troops killed said one analyst speaking condition anonymity who familiar with the pentagon reports allied deaths were put americans friendly fire british american fire frenchmen italian and among various arab allies the postwar reassessments the most widely publicized was the army reluctant acknowledgement months later that its touted patriot air defense system was nowhere near effective claimed against iraq scud missiles the bush administration initially claimed almost perfect record for the patriot last spring revised the hit ratio percent the success record the navy tomahawk high tech cruise missile used against targets baghdad and other parts iraq also turned out more modest than initially indicated the pentagon the first iraqi casualty figures surface after the war came may report the environmental group greenpeace which said iraqi soldiers were killed estimated that iraqi civilians were also killed the same month published reports said the defense intelligence agency estimated iraqi soldiers were killed and wounded the air and ground campaigns although the agency qualified that saying the estimate could off much percent either direction but more information became available those figures gradually were revised downward the house armed services committee staff estimated dead and wounded after review last year but heidenrich writing the current issue the quarterly foreign policy estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives low with about wounded heidenrich based the conclusion his article the number bodies found and buried troops and prisoner war interviews noted that only about iraqi prisoners war were wounded based the calculation that about half many wounded escaped were captured put the number wounded about using conservative ratio one dead two wounded applicable third world armies like iraq set battlefield deaths maybe the figures are too low wrote maybe the real death toll the battlefield was even even then the evidence suggests death toll well below even interview said the figure was obviously off base because would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers the kuwait theater operations were casualties said today bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology but rather the drawn out conflicts such those yugoslavia and somalia

18 drugs and crime new approach mwilson ncratl atlantaga ncr com mark wilson writes missing the entire point post kebarnes msuvx memst edu wrote given that the trade illegal drugs responsible for much the crime which afflicts our nation there much evidence that the fact that the drugs are illegal not the drugs themselves that have caused the violence witness prohibition and the violence that surrounded the trade alcohol joke people who want drugs particularly people who are predisposed addiction will find way get them whether not they are legally available this suppossed argument for keeping drugs illegal you jumped that conclusion actually argument how accomplish the societal good discouraging drug use without violating individual rights despite current law enforcement efforts drugs are readily available those who want them this suppossed argument for keeping drugs illegal you missed the point the point the war drugs failure and counterproductive addiction drugs boh legal and illegal responsible for significant drain the productive resources our country and this occurs variety ways from the cocaine addicted babies who are unable learn the spread disease among addicts the tragic consequences alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking the crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited just happens that the symptoms seen the crack babies are identical fetal alcohol syndrome and the mothers who admitted taking crack also admitted drinking heavily during pregnancy this country people are free stupid they want but they are not free stupid and injure other people admittedly the fetal right life outside the scope this discussion however ridiculous assert you apparently that cocaine has effect the developing fetal nervous system caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects too why should cocaine any exception general economic principle government that whatever subsidized you get more and whatever taxed you get less most effective confronting the nation drug problem some way must found utilize these additional powers government make drug dealing and drug use less attractive make the drugs legal tax them and use the tax money fund program tell people how studid drugs are has worked for the legal drugs you had read article before writing your knee jerk response you would have seen that this exactly what advocated while this country current efforts combat legal drugs have succeeded some respects there greater awareness the health consequences smoking and designated driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving for example the same cannot said for the war illegal drugs there remains core group illegal drug users which support international networks smugglers pushers growers processors kingpins and gangsters these networks and their marketing activities which include drive shootings corrupting law enforcement authorities and smuggling weapons are directly indirectly responsible for large proportion the crimes committed our country every day each and every one these problems direct result the drug trade being illegal shit sherlock clearly illegal drugs and rising crime are linked takes only moment reflection recognize how they are linked the link money with this country failed effort prohibit alcohol consumption black market has been created which greedy local monopolies like the gangsters bygone era have profited enormously from their illegal trade the victims this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough caught the crossfire but would argue the drug users themselves great argument for making drugs legal thank you how could you have missed the point utterly what have you been smoking here then proposal possession and use all presently illegal drugs decriminalized but buying and selling them remains illegal potheads can grow their own marijuana many already today other drug users can legally import their poison choice long they pay the tariffs and barter economy drug experimenters develops your solution has done nothing eliminate the violence the drug trade btw how someone going import drug buying illegal think you need think your solution through little more thouroughly obviously importers will not buying drugs the under jurisdiction use your remaining brain cells because the barter economy which supplies the drug users the black market profits that have enriched the drug lords dwindle these drugs can obtained for free next nothing why buy them nevertheless there will those who will seek sell these noncommercial drugs even relatively low prices therefore you have failed indicate how these drugs can obtained for free next nothing you have stated that the sale them illegal spell out for you barter economy means that drug users will permitted grow synthesize chemically anything they choose buy outside the and bring won grow here they will also permitted trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow manufacture they will not however able legally sell their drugs for money both manufacture and importation noncommercial drugs will taxed discourage their use this your brain drugs any questions law enforcement activity concentrated those individuals who continue buy and sell and also the crimes committed drug users too poor afford even low prices but here where the strategy begins differentiate between the drug dealers the victimizers and the drug users their victims most cities this already the strategy has already failed and dragging the rest down with pardon but possession use these drugs still crime you cannot analogize the rates which drug users would seek treatment and the comparative ease with which could made available today when these drugs are illegal possess use with what would were they not illegal possess use decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment much easier drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses those persons who are prone addiction and such the drug users should left alone not thrown prison along with their victimizers drug dealers are the criminals and should treated such drug addiction does not absolve you responsiblity for your criminal actions however upon arrest for any crime suspects are permitted choose whether not they will undergo drug test those who choose cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused they are found drug user they will institutionalized until they are clean and only then will they begin serve their sentence they choose cooperate and are already drug free they can begin serve their sentence right away those who choose not undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences this sounds hell lot like self incrimination which unconstitutional drug use legal your scheme why should the presence drugs anyones system influence the penalty they receive much too big brotherish for tastes the drug test arrested suspect voluntary not coerced and does not therefore constitute violation amendment those convicted who are drug users evidenced the test are need treatment for their problem institutionalization these adddicted criminals would argue the best way help them straighten out they refuse the test and are convicted their sentence can appropriately harsher since they unlike the addict have excuse for their crimes institutionalization drug using criminals serves several purposes drug using criminals and this includes drunk and stoned drivers are separated from their sources supply thus reducing the total number drug users society large and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs the street putting more the remaining drug dealers out business why should drug using criminals treated any different from other criminals you have already stated that drug use legal mark wilson atlantaga ncr com why not objective discourage drug use and criminal behavior fewer criminals drugs out fear getting harsher

15 christianity crisis from bit listserv christia zane writes from facn saupm bitnet zane dhahan newsgroups bit listserv christia subject christianity crisis date wed may frank first all thanks for all the great scripture verses was pleasure read them reply you are welcome zane zane sure nothing that will say will change your mind about but would like ask you the book question really does anything for you mean were you all caught the word faith thing but now that you have read the book you been rescued from all the error and pain that will result your christian life reply when first became christian entered into the word faith movement was easy wasn grounded the word god and sound doctrine when visited christian book stores the cheapest books could find buy were the and books hagin and others consequently began receiving hagin monthly magazine and they still send and also copeland also still sent wasn until read booklet jimmy swaggart called hyper faith the new gnosticism that began realize the teachings were partaking were error started reading the bible more and studying more sure enough jimmy was right many points part experience alerting christians particularly new christians that these teachings are heretical and they need the bereans did acts check these teachings out with scripture brother law was involved word faith cult area leader real good friends with benny hinn rather then going into much detail about this suffice say was deceived mistreated and has now fallen into atheism still praying for him phil the assistant pastor the church teach adult sunday school has been follower copeland for years has thousands tapes the faith teachers the class recently quoted several the teachers heretical statements his surprise since then been able talk him length about these issues the leader the women group church benny hinn fan recently found that she has been lending good morning holy spirit women the church that prompted quotes sunday school well lending cic people the church well aware the abuses and heresies perpetrated this movement and have urgency heart and life warn people about the heresies what heresies jesus became sin took the very nature the devil and became one with him jesus death the cross wasn enough atone jesus was dragged hell after his death was beat and abused satan and demons thus finishing our atonement satan was ruling over him there jesus was born again hell jesus died spiritually lost his divinity and reassumed after the resurrection are gods these are heresies documentation will provided these teachings upon request zane what does for you preventing you from going out and joining with the word faith movement which you been contemplating joining for long but now that you read the book you been saved from all that reply wasn christianity crisis that helped was booklet swaggart that mentioned above but cic much much better tremendous documentation and insights zane don have nice scriptural answer for why believe best profitable for christians engage this type activity heresy hunting reply why you call heresy hunting hunting implies isn readily accessible available this movement the fastest growing movement christendom hagin has sold over million books and booklets hinn has sold more books the last couple years than swindoll and dobson combined fred price has the largest church terms seating capacity the usa doesn sound like much hunting needed scriptural expose doctrinal error gave some verses you before more can given most the epistles were written due error doctrinal practical the churches the early church had numerous councils expose error and heresy not new thing remember luther zane would like point out though that historically those who hunt heretics often end causing bigger mess than the heretics but this documented opinion reply you can provide documentation would appreciated read ephesians esp vss and and tell what causes disunity and immaturity the body eph till all come the unity the faith and the knowledge the son god perfect man the measure the stature the fullness christ that should longer children tossed and fro and carried about with every wind doctrine the trickery men the cunning craftiness deceitful plotting disunity contrary popular opinion isn caused exposing error caused error zane there are many who probably give place for seeing the scriptures documenting spiritual development growth its writers but would suggest that the fiery paul the letter the galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake love the end reply most scholars believe paul wrote timothy last let examine his admonitions tim ascertain how mellow had become hold fast the pattern sound words which you have heard from faith and love which are christ jesus that good thing which was committed you keep the holy spirit who dwells this you know that all those asia have turned away from among whom are phygellus and hermogenes diligent present yourself approved god worker who does not need ashamed rightly dividing the word truth but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection already past and they overthrow the faith some and servant the lord must not quarrel but gentle all able teach patient humility correcting those who are opposition god perhaps will grant them repentance that they may know the truth and that they may come their senses and escape the snare the devil having been taken captive him his will for this sort are those who creep into households and make captives gullible women loaded down with sins led away various lusts always learning and never able come the knowledge the truth now jannes and jambres resisted moses these also resist the truth men corrupt minds disapproved concerning the faith but they will progress further for their folly will manifest all theirs also was yes and all who desire live godly christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but you must continue the things which you have learned and been assured knowing from whom you have learned them and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures which are able make you wise for salvation through faith which christ jesus all scripture given inspiration god and profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction righteousness that the man god may complete thoroughly equipped for every good work preach the word ready season and out season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but according their own desires because they have itching ears they will heap for themselves teachers and they will turn their ears away from the truth and turned aside fables but you watchful all things endure afflictions the work evangelist fulfill your ministry alexander the coppersmith did much harm may the lord repay him according his works you also must beware him for has greatly resisted our words zane the picture have paul not one who goes out his way destroy the ministry wolves but one who teaches the sheep with many tears the necessity absolutely not allowing themselves transformed into wolves protect themselves reply act therefore testify you this day that innocent the blood all men for have not shunned declare you the whole counsel god therefore take heed yourselves and all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers shepherd the church god which purchased with his own blood for know this that after departure savage wolves will come among you not sparing the flock also from among yourselves men will rise speaking perverse things draw away the disciples after themselves therefore watch and remember that for three years did not cease warn everyone night and day with tears zane for all the warning paul does note that never once drops name wolf but will admit cries his beard the end over those who have abandoned him everyone asia wasn reply paul mentioned names this charge commit you son timothy according the prophecies previously made concerning you that them you may wage the good warfare having faith and good conscience which some having rejected concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck whom are hymenaeus and alexander whom delivered satan that they may learn not blaspheme this you know that all those asia have turned away from among whom are phygellus and hermogenes but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection already past and they overthrow the faith some for demas has forsaken having loved this present world and has departed for thessalonica crescens for galatia titus for dalmatia alexander the coppersmith did much harm may the lord repay him according his works you also must beware him for has greatly resisted our words did john wrote the church but diotrephes who loves have the preeminence among them does not receive therefore come will call mind his deeds which does prating against with malicious words and not content with that himself does not receive the brethren and forbids those who wish putting them out the church jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines rev but have few things against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine balaam who taught balak put stumbling block before the children israel eat things sacrificed idols and commit sexual immorality thus you also have those who hold the doctrine the nicolaitans which thing hate repent else will come you quickly and will fight against them with the sword mouth rev nevertheless have few things against you because you allow that woman jezebel who calls herself prophetess teach and seduce servants commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed idols and gave her time repent her sexual immorality and she did not repent indeed will cast her into sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent their deeds will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that who searches the minds and hearts and will give each one you according your works zane question too the purposes those who write books and build ministries the faults deliberate otherwise others maybe they would wander around the desert eating locust and honey barely cakes with worldly goods stake money made reputations maintain would question their motives conscious otherwise less reply won comment this because deals with the intangible motives others but even they had bad motives remember what paul said phi some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing add affliction chains but the latter out love knowing that appointed for the defense the gospel what then only that every way whether pretense truth christ preached and this rejoice yes and will rejoice zane want true the admonitions scripture many which you list about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds doctrines suggest start allowing the wolf program our own noetic pasture nailed the cross reply please explain zane secondly suggest any heresy hunting restricted our own fellowships which the strict scriptural sense the local city church reply heresy was not being propagated over the mass media then may not needed mass media with the exposure unfortunately heresy being taught not just copeland church hagin hinn price but all over the radio print etc pastor church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding outside the church imperative that leadership made aware this and cic does just that also let examine passage scripture eph and himself gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers eph for the equipping the saints for the work ministry for the edifying the body christ these ministry gifts that the lord installs the church are not just for one individual church but for the body christ paul was apostle traveled all over distilling his message was also teacher for this reason have sent timothy you who beloved and faithful son the lord who will remind you ways christ teach everywhere every church but god has distributed each one the lord has called each one let him walk and ordain all the churches also and god has appointed these the church first apostles second prophets third teachers after that miracles then gifts healings helps administrations varieties tongues eph till all come the unity the faith and the knowledge the son god perfect man the measure the stature the fullness christ notice that the five fold ministries are going around till the church unity the faith and the knowledge the son god perfect man this believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns see cor but god wants the body continue maturing what hinders maturity and unity the body eph that should longer children tossed and fro and carried about with every wind doctrine the trickery men the cunning craftiness deceitful plotting clear that false doctrine integrated into the church the trickery men causes disunity the thing are striving for and spiritual immaturity the church continues spiritual childhood when christians are tossed and fro and carried about with every wind doctrine the five fold ministry which there does not appear clear scriptural denominational boundaries pastors appear responsible for their individual flock deal with these doctrines when necessary their struggle equip the body all believers are called this degree jud beloved while was very diligent write you concerning our common salvation found necessary write you exhorting you contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered the saints for certain men have crept unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ zane you notice scripture the heresy hunters that went from church church and area area were the bad guys and they went after the good guy namely paul who they considered the arch heretic reply they were themselves heretics trying discredit paul who was preaching contrary what they taught zane let face the wolves are here for reason and are here for the reason and let hope the wolves become sheep and the sheep lambs reply yes and servant the lord must not quarrel but gentle all able teach patient humility correcting those who are opposition god perhaps will grant them repentance that they may know the truth and that they may come their senses and escape the snare the devil having been taken captive him his will amen frank one wished contend with him could not answer him one time out thousand job
