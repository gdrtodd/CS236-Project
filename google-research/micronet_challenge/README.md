# MicroNet Challenge Counting Operations and Parameters.

This folder includes tools for counting operations and parameters of a neural
network. Using the tools at `counting.py` we count the operations and parameters
of the base [EfficientNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946).

You can run the Colab directly [at this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/micronet_challenge/EfficientNetCounting.ipynb)!
