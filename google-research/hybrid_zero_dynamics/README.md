The library contains MATLAB scripts to generate locomotion gaits for quadruped robots.

Requirements:

* FROST (Fast Robot Optimization and Simulation Toolkit): https://github.com/ayonga/frost-dev

Usage:

A basic example is provided in matlab/minitaur_simple/main_opt.m. You may need
to change the variable "frost_path" to your FROST installation directory.
