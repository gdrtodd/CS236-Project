# On Mutual Information Maximization and Representation Learning

This is a companion Colab for the paper:<br/>
"On Mutual Information Maximization for Representation Learning" <br/>
Michael Tschannen*, Josip Djolonga*, Paul Rubenstein, Sylvain Gelly, and Mario Lucic <br />

Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/mutual_information_representation_learning/mirl.ipynb) to launch the Colab.

By default, the precomputed results will be loaded, but individual experiments can be run with the Colab by checking the `RUN_EXPERIMENTS` checkbox. The batch size used in the paper was 128 and we average over 20 runs. With one run, the entire set of experiments will complete in ~2 hours. For multiple runs we suggest copying the code and running a stand-alone version. If you wish to run the experiments within the Colab, make sure you execute all cells in the "Setup" section.
