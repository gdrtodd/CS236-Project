# Property Linking

##Distantly Supervised Property Linking


Property linking is a new problem, where the goal is to find references to
"properties" in text. We will explore property linking with distant data
consisting of a KB plus a set of pairs (d, y) where d is a textual description
of a set, and y is a noisy set of KB entities that share some properties.
