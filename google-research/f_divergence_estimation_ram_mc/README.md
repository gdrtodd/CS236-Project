# Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences

This Colab accompanies the NeurIPS 2019 paper:

**Practical and Consistent Estimation of f-Divergences**
([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11112)) \
*Paul K. Rubenstein, Olivier Bousquet, Josip Djolonga, Carlos Riquelme and
Ilya Tolstikhin*

Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/f_divergence_estimation_ram_mc/ram_mc.ipynb)
to launch the Colab.

By default precomputed results are loaded for plotting, but ticking the
appropriate boxes in the Colab allows the experiments to be run from scratch.

See `requirements.txt` for required packages if running locally.
